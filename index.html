    <h1 style= "text-align:center"> Comparison of Net Charge-Offs from Puerto Rican Banks </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> OFG Bank and Banco Popular have had unique paths with the percentage of their loans that
         they have had to write off as uncollectable since 2005. The percentage of loans that are written off is tracked by what is called
         a Net Charge Off ratio and below we will track how the ratio trended for these two banks in Puerto Rico since 2005.
